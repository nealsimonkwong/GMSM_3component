# This is an example input file for IM_EventSetCal program.
#
# All lines that start with "#" here are comments and are ignored by the code (and can be removed if you want); 
# Choices below can be modified by uncommenting the "#";   
# The order of non-comment lines is important!
#
#
# First line defines which Earthquake Rupture Forecast (ERF) to use
# choose one of the following four choices (and remove quotes):
# "WGCEP (2007) UCERF2 - Single Branch"
# "USGS/CGS 2002 Adj. Cal. ERF"
# "WGCEP UCERF 1.0 (2005)"
# "GEM1 CEUS ERF"
# "Mean UCERF3"
# "Mean UCERF3 FM3.1"
# "Mean UCERF3 FM3.2"
# 
# Notes on UCERF3: If Mean UCERF3 FM3.1 or FM3.2 are selected, you can also append the start year and duration in order to use UCERF3-TD.
# Example: "Mean UCERF3 FM3.1 2014 30" for 30 year forecast starting in 2014. This only works for fault model specific Mean UCERF3 forecasts.
# Additionally, much more memory is required for UCERF3. It is recommended that you run it with -Xmx2G or greater.
# Finally, the UCERF3 model requires a fast internet connection when run for the first time with any given configuration as it downloads model files.

#
# Second line indicates how to handle background seismicity.  Options are "Include", "Exclude", and "Only Background".
Exclude
# Third line defines rupture offset for floating ruptures. Not applicable to UCERF3, but a value is still required.
# (between 1 and 100 km; 5 km is generally best)
5
#
# Fourth line specifies number N of Attenuation Relations
1
# One the next N lines, identify the N attenuation 
# relationships from the following options
# (first five are final NGA-West2 relationships, followed by 2008 NGA-West releationships):
# "Abrahamson, Silva & Kamai (2014)"
# "Boore, Stewart, Seyhan & Atkinson (2014)"

# Next, first choose the number of Intensity Measure Types to consider 
# in this calculation, and then specify those Intensity Measure Types.  
#
# Currently the following are supported: "PGA", "PGV", "SA", and "MMI".  
#
# If "SA" is chosen, then  give the period as well in one of the following formats
# (format will be automatically detected):
#		HAZO1: SAxy where x.y is the period (e.g., "SA10" for 1 second, and "SA02" for 0.2 seconds).
#		Regular: SA period (e.g., "SA 1.0" for 1 second, "SA 0.2" for 0.2 seconds)
# The code will throw and exception (show an error message) if the chosen 
# intensity-measure type is not supported by the chosen attenuation 
# relationship (the html documentation given above lists those that are supported)
# 
# Number of IMTs for which computation needs to be done
21
# Identify those IMT's:
SA 0.01
SA 0.02
SA 0.03
SA 0.05
SA 0.075
SA 0.1
SA 0.15
SA 0.2
SA 0.25
SA 0.3
SA 0.4
SA 0.5
SA 0.75
SA 1.0
SA 1.5
SA 2.0
SA 3.0
SA 4.0
SA 5.0
SA 7.5
SA 10.0

# Next, give the number of sites and then the lat, lon, and  
# Vs30 (m/sec) or Wills site classification for each. If no Vs30 is given, then it will 
# default to the Vs30 given by a digitized version of the 
# Wills et al. (2006, BSSA, v. 96; no. 4A; p. 1483-1501). This latter
# feature requires internet access.
#
# Specify the number of sites:
1
# Enter the Lat, Lon, and optionally Vs30 or Wills class on a separate line for each:
# e.g., "34.1 -118.1 760"  
38.54 -121.74 760
